# History 

Pop! OS was my first Linux distrubtion and I stayed with it for a span of 2 years. After that I moved to Arch Linux as it offered a minimal distribution that can be customized in any way. I had been using i3wm for a long time until my very recent switch to hyprland. I dont have any issues with it so far, except a bit of trouble with screen sharing which I managed to fix pretty easily.
