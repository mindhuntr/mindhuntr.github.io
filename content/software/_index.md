# History 

Pop! OS was my first Linux distrubtion and I stayed with it for a span of 2 years. After that I moved to Arch Linux as it offered a minimal distribution that can be customized in any way. So I am currently running Arch with i3 wm. As much as I would one day like to try hyprland, I think I have grown too comfortable with the setup that I have now.

These are some of the softwares I use:
