I am a student of psycholgy who is also equally fascinated by computers. I stumbled upon Linux a few years ago and soon became immersed in its world where I discovered many things pertaining to the internet and how technology itself has evolved, in some ways, to our deteriment. I write to explore these problems and many other things I have discovered since.

# Why the Site

I have been writing for more than three years now and have used several platforms to publish my work. However I have remained dissatified with the decisions taken by these platforms over the years and how they curate content. I have wanted to create a personal website for myself and I eventually resolved to do it. 

So you can expect all of my work to be published here. I have used [hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate this site and github pages to host it. Its relatively simple but aligns with my intention to provide a minimal website that emphasizes content more than aesthetics.
