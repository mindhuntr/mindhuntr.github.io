I seek thee, O'Eternal One\
Through words I utter in unison 

As I struggle to keep thee in me\
I lose myself, perpetually, in reverie 

Underneath the beauty of sonnets I see thine stride\
Between sound and rhythm thou holds the divide 

Embrasures, I sculpt, to beckon thine love\
That radiates through time or lack thereof

Bewildered, I beseech thee\
To relieve the ephemeral within me

Yet, thou departs in your weary travel\
Afraid that I might unravel 

Lost in time, I forever seek thee in vain\
Not knowing that in your memory lies a path to the eternal plane
