Why the Site I have been writing for more than three years now and have used several platforms to publish my work. However I have remained dissatified with the decisions taken by these platforms over the years and how they curate content. I have wanted to create a personal website for myself and I eventually resolved to do it.

      <p>I am a student of psycholgy who is also equally fascinated by computers.

<h1 id="why-the-site">Why the Site</h1>
<p>I have been writing for more than three years now and have used several platforms to publish my work. However I have remained dissatified with the decisions taken by these platforms over the years and how they curate content. I have wanted to create a personal website for myself and I eventually resolved to do it.</p>
<p>So you can expect all of my work to be published here. I have used <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a> to generate this site and github pages to host it. Its relatively simple but aligns with my intention to provide a minimal website that emphasizes content more than aesthetics.</p>
<h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>
<p>I go by mindhunter on Libera Chat and the Tilde Network. You can pm me to get in touch</p>
<p>You can also mail me at <a href="mailto:mindhunter@blinkenshell.org">mindhunter@blinkenshell.org</a></p>
